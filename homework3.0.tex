\section{A-TM-abba is undecidable}
Proof by reduction and contradiction with assumption A-TM-abba is decidable. From the assumption, we can construct decider N(input = [M]) to decide A-TM-abba. We can construct decider O(input = [M, w]) to decide A-TM:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item construct TM P(input = x):
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item run M on w
		\item if M accepts w: accept x
	\end{enumerate}
	\item run N on [P]
	\item if N accepts [P]: accept [M, w]
	\item if N rejects [P]: reject [M, w]
\end{enumerate}
This is a contradiction with A-TM is undecidable. Therefore, A-TM-abba is undecidable.

\section{E-jump-LBA is undecidable}
Proof by reduction and contradiction with assumption jump-LBA is decidable. From the assumption, we can construct decider N(input = [M]) to decide E-jump-LBA. We can construct decider O(input=[M, w]) to decide A-TM:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item construct jump-LBA P(input = x) to accept accepting computation histories of M on w:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item verify x has valid computation history format: [configuration[1], configuration[2] ... configuration[n]]
		\item verify configuration[1] is the initial configuration for M on w
		\item verify configuration[n] is an accepting configuration for M
		\item verify every configuration transition is valid (verifying adjacent configurations are identical except for positions under and adjacent to the head have changed according to the transition function of M)
	\end{enumerate}
	\item Run N on [P]
	\item if N accepts [P]: reject [M, w]
	\item if N rejects [P]: accept [M, w]
\end{enumerate}
This is a contradiction with A-TM is undecidable. Therefore, E-jump-LBA is undecidable.
