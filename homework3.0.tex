\section{A-TM-abba is undecidable}
Proof by reduction(from A-TM to A-TM-abba) and contradiction(assumption: 
A-TM-abba is decidable).
We can construct decider O(input = [P, w], where P is a TM and w is a word) to decide A-TM:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item construct TM Q(input = x, where x is a word) to accept abba if P 
	accepts w:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item run P on w
		\item if P accepts w: accept x
	\end{enumerate}
	\item if Q accepts abba (decidable by assumption): accept [P, w]
	\item else: reject [P, w]
\end{enumerate}
This is a contradiction with A-TM is undecidable. Therefore, A-TM-abba is undecidable.

\section{E-jump-LBA is undecidable}
Proof by reduction(from A-2CM to E-jump-LBA) and contradiction(assumption: 
E-jump-LBA is decidable).
We can construct decider O(input=[P], where P is a 2CM) to decide A-2CM:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item construct jump-LBA Q(input = [w], where w is a word) to accept accepting computation histories of P:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item assert w has valid computation history format: [c[1], c[2], ..., c[l]], where c[i] = [instruction, state, counter1, counter2]
		\item assert c[1] is the initial configuration for P
		\item assert all configuration transitions are valid (mark, jump and move to next symbol to check adjacent configurations: read instruction, check state and counter updates)
		\item assert c[l] is an accepting configuration for P
		\item accept w
	\end{enumerate}
	\item L(Q) is empty (decidable by assumption): reject [P]
	\item else: accept [P]
\end{enumerate}
This is a contradiction with A-2CM is undecidable. Therefore, E-jump-LBA is undecidable.

\section{Language is in RE}
As L is in R, we can construct decider M(input = [w], where w is a word) to decide L. Therefore we can construct TM N(input = x) to accept L':
\begin{enumerate}
	\item guess word y
	\item run M on yxy
	\item if M accepts yxy: accept x
\end{enumerate}
As TM N accepts L', L' is in RE.

\section{Reverse of R is R}
As L is decidable, we can construct decider M to decide L. Therefore we can construct decider N(input = x) to decide $ L^r $:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item reverse x in place to get $ x^r $ by swapping corresponding symbol pairs
	\item run M on $ x^r $
	\item if M accepts $ x^r $: accept x
	\item if M rejects $ x^r $: reject x
\end{enumerate}
As decider N decide $ L^r $, $ L^r $ is decidable.

\section{E-read-only-2-TM is undecidable}
Proof by reduction(from A-2CM to E-read-only-2-TM) and contradiction(assumption 
that E-read-only-2-TM is decidable).
We can construct decider O(input = [P], where P is a 2CM) to decide A-2CM:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item construct read-only-2-TM Q(input = [w], where w is a word) to accept 
	non-empty language if P halts:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item simulate P with its head coordinates simulating the counters
		\item if the simulation finishes, accept w
	\end{enumerate}
	\item if L(Q) is empty (decidable by assumption): reject [P]
	\item else: accept [P]
\end{enumerate}
This is a contradiction with A-2CM is undecidable. Therefore, E-read-only-2-TM is undecidable.
