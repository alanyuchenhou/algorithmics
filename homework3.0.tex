\section{A-TM-abba is undecidable}
Proof by reduction and contradiction with assumption A-TM-abba is decidable. From the assumption, we can construct decider N(input = [M]) to decide A-TM-abba. We can construct decider O(input = [M, w]) to decide A-TM:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item construct TM P(input = x):
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item run M on w
		\item if M accepts w: accept x
	\end{enumerate}
	\item run N on [P]
	\item if N accepts [P]: accept [M, w]
	\item if N rejects [P]: reject [M, w]
\end{enumerate}
This is a contradiction with A-TM is undecidable. Therefore, A-TM-abba is undecidable.

\section{E-jump-LBA is undecidable}
Proof by reduction and contradiction with assumption E-jump-LBA is decidable. From the assumption, we can construct decider N(input = [M]) to decide E-jump-LBA. We can construct decider O(input=[M, w]) to decide A-TM:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item construct jump-LBA P(input = x) to accept accepting computation histories of M on w:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item verify x has valid computation history format: [configuration[1], configuration[2] ... configuration[n]]
		\item verify configuration[1] is the initial configuration for M on w
		\item verify configuration[n] is an accepting configuration for M
		\item verify every configuration transition is valid (verifying adjacent configurations are identical except for positions under and adjacent to the head have changed according to the transition function of M)
	\end{enumerate}
	\item Run N on [P]
	\item if N accepts [P]: reject [M, w]
	\item if N rejects [P]: accept [M, w]
\end{enumerate}
This is a contradiction with A-TM is undecidable. Therefore, E-jump-LBA is undecidable.

\section{Language is in RE}
As L is in R, we can construct decider M to decide L. Therefore we can construct TM N(input = x) to accept L':
\begin{enumerate}
	\item guess word y
	\item run M on yxy
	\item if M accepts yxy: accept x
\end{enumerate}
As TM N accepts L', L' is in RE.

\section{Reverse of R is R}
As L is decidable, we can construct decider M to decide L. Therefore we can construct decider N(input = x) to decide $ L^r $:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item reverse x in place to get $ x^r $ by swapping corresponding symbol pairs: first symbol with last symbol, second symbol with second last symbol, etc
	\item run M on $ x^r $
	\item if M accepts $ x^r $: accept x
	\item if M rejects $ x^r $: reject x
\end{enumerate}
As decider N decide $ L^r $, $ L^r $ is decidable.

\section{E-read-only-2-TM is undecidable}
Proof by reduction and contradiction with assumption that E-read-only-2-TM is decidable. From the assumption, there is decider N to decide E-read-only-2-TM. Then there is decider O(input = [M]) to decide E-2CM:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item verify M is 2CM
	\item construct read-only-2-TM P(input = x) to simulate M:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item use the x coordinate of the head to simulate counter x in M
		\item use the y coordinate of the head to simulate counter y in M
	\end{enumerate}
	\item run N on [P]
	\item if N accepts [P]: accept M
	\item if N rejects [P]: reject M
\end{enumerate}
This contradicts theorem[E-2CM is undecidable]. Therefore, E-read-only-2-TM is undecidable.
