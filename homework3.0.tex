\section{A-TM-abba is undecidable}
Proof by reduction(from A-TM to A-TM-abba) and contradiction(assumption: 
A-TM-abba is decidable).
From the assumption, there is decider M (input = [N], where N is a TM) to 
decide A-TM-abba.
There is decider O(input = [P, w], where P is a TM and w is a word) to decide 
A-TM:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item there is TM Q(input = x) to accept all words if P accepts w:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item run P on w
		\item if P accepts w: accept
	\end{enumerate}
	\item if Q accepts abba (decidable by M): accept
	\item else: reject
\end{enumerate}
This is a contradiction with A-TM is undecidable. Therefore, A-TM-abba is undecidable.

\section{E-jump-LBA is undecidable}
Proof by reduction(from A-2CM to E-jump-LBA) and contradiction(assumption: 
E-jump-LBA is decidable).
From the assumption, there is decider M (input = [N], where N is a jump-LBA) to 
decide E-jump-LBA.
There is decider O(input=[P], where P is a 2CM) to decide A-2CM:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item there is jump-LBA Q(input = w) to accept halting histories of P:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item assert w has valid computation history format: [c[1], c[2], ..., c[l]], where c[i] = [instruction, state, counter1, counter2]
		\item assert c[1] is the initial configuration for P
		\item assert all configuration transitions are valid (mark, jump and move to next symbol to check adjacent configurations: read instruction, check state and counter updates)
		\item assert c[l] is an accepting configuration for P
		\item accept
	\end{enumerate}
	\item L(Q) is empty (decidable by M): reject
	\item else: accept
\end{enumerate}
This is a contradiction with A-2CM is undecidable. Therefore, E-jump-LBA is undecidable.

\section{Language is RE}
As L is in R, there is decider M (input = w) to decide L. 
Therefore there is TM N (input = x) to accept L':
\begin{enumerate}
	\item run M
	\item for each symbol c in word yxy (guess y): feed c to M
	\item if M accepts: accept
\end{enumerate}
Therefore L' is RE.

\section{Reverse of R is R}
As L is R, there is decider M (input = w) to decide L.
Therefore there is decider N (input = x) to decide $ L^r $:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item reverse x in place to get $ x^r $ by swapping corresponding symbol pairs
	\item run M on $ x^r $
	\item if M accepts: accept
	\item else: reject
\end{enumerate}
$ \implies L^r $ is R.

\section{E-read-only-2-TM is undecidable}
Proof by reduction (from A-2CM to E-read-only-2-TM) and 
contradiction(assumption: E-read-only-2-TM is decidable).
From the assumption, there is decider M (input = [N], where N is a 
read-only-2-TM) to decide E-read-only-2-TM.
There is decider O(input = [P], where P is a 2CM) to decide A-2CM:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item there is read-only-2-TM Q (input = w) to accept all words if P halts:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item simulate P with its head coordinates simulating the counters
		\item if the simulation finishes: accept
	\end{enumerate}
	\item if L(Q) is empty (decidable by M): reject
	\item else: accept
\end{enumerate}
This is a contradiction with A-2CM is undecidable. Therefore, E-read-only-2-TM is undecidable.
