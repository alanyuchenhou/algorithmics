\section{Termination of Presburger formula is undecidable}
Proof by reduction (from A-2CM to Termination of Presburger formula) and 
contradiction (assumption: Termination of Presburger formula is decidable). 
From the assumption, we can construct decider M (input = F(x, y, z, x', y', 
z'), where F is a formula ) to decide termination of Presburger formula:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item if F terminates: accept F
	\item else: reject F
\end{enumerate}
We can use M to decide A-2CM N:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item encode N's transition function $ \delta(q, x, y) $ 
	(where q is the state and x, y are counts) as formula F(q, x, y, q', x', 
	y') such 
	that F(q, x, y, q', x', y') = true $ \iff \delta(q, x, y) = (q', x', y') $
	\item N terminates $ \iff $ N has an accepting computation history: $ 
	\exists n \exists q_1 ... q_n, x_1 ... x_n, y_1 ... y_n : F(0, 0, 0, 
	q_1, x_1, y_1) \land ... \land F(q_n, x_n, y_n, 1, 1, 1) = true$
\end{enumerate}
This is a contradiction with A-2CM is undecidable. Therefore termination of 
Presburger formula is undecidable.

\section{LP is decidable}
Proof by reduction: from LP to satisfiability of Presburger formula. LP is 
equivalent to given formula $ F(x_1 ... x_n, y) $ whether the following formula 
is satisfiable:
\begin{align*}
	LP \iff& \forall x_1 ... x_n \in Z (K \ge y \land F(x_1 ... x_n)) \land 
	\exists x_1 ... x_n \in Z (K = y \land F(x_1 ... x_n) )
\end{align*}
This is the satisfiability of Presburger formula, a decidable problem. 
Therefore LP is decidable.

\section{A Linear formula is a Presburger formula}

\section{Satisfiability of mixed-linear formula is decidable}

Proof by reduction from satisfiability of mixed-linear formula to linear 
formula or to linear formula and Presburger formula.

\subsection{Reduction to linear formula}
A mixed-linear-formula f can be reduced to a linear formula by boolean variable 
elimination:
\begin{align*}
	f(x_1 ... x_k, y_1 ... y_m)
	&= f(x_1 ... x_k, 0 ... 0)\\
	&\lor f(x_1 ... x_k, 0 ... 1)\\
	&\lor f(x_1 ... x_k, 1 ... 0)\\
	&\lor f(x_1 ... x_k, 1 ... 1)\\
\end{align*}
The additive theory of reals is decidable, therefore satisfiability of 
mixed-linear-constraint is decidable.

\subsection{Reduction to linear formula}
A mixed-linear-formula f can be separated into 2 parts - an integral part and a 
real part - by splitting every real variable into an integral part and a real 
part: $ y = z + w $ where y is real, z is integer and y is real in range(0, 1). 
Then we do quantifier elimination on each part separately. The satisfiability 
of real formula and Presburger formula is decidable, therefore the 
satisfiability of mixed-linear formula is satisfiable.
